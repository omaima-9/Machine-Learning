## 1- least squares-based classification algorithm
a least squares-based classification algorithm that can recognize 
the Iris flower type in the Iris dataset. The objective is to classify each data point (row) in the file 
“Test.csv” to one of the three types of flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) using the 
least squares classifier

## 2- Perceptron-based classification algorithm
a Perceptron-based classification algorithm that can recognize scanned images of the 10 digits (0 to 9). The Training images should be used to 
train a classifier for each digit. a file named “Training Labels.txt” which includes the labels of the 2400 images. 
For all Perceptrons, an initial weight vector was useed that has 1 as the first component (w1) and the rest are zeros. To include the bias term, 
I appended a constant value equal to 1 to all input vectors and adjusted the size of the weight vector accordingly.
